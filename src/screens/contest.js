    desc: `Ecosystem regeneration involves restoring degraded ecosystems to their natural and healthy state. This is crucial for addressing climate change, as healthy ecosystems act as carbon sinks, absorbing and storing carbon from the atmosphere in soil and vegetation. Additionally, ecosystem regeneration has implications for food security, as it supports robust and diverse agricultural systems. Measuring carbon export from ecosystems helps track progress in regeneration by quantifying the amount of carbon sequestered. Combining these measurements with assessments of food security provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ecosystem regeneration on the environment and human well-being.`,

    title: "Panel Discussion : French Panel Session",
    desc: `The power of collaboration between groups and industries cannot be overstated. When different groups come together to share their knowledge, skills, and resources, they can achieve more significant outcomes than they could individually. Collaboration can lead to new ideas, increased innovation, and more comprehensive problem-solving. However, collaboration can also encounter obstacles, such as conflicting priorities, lack of trust, communication barriers, and power imbalances. Overcoming these obstacles requires a willingness to listen, compromise, and build trust. Through effective collaboration, groups and industries can achieve common goals and create more significant positive impact for themselves and society as a whole.`,
