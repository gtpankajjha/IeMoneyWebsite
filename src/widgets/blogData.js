          "Now is a wonderful time to lead a life with a purpose, according to 85-year-old “billionaire” Jeremy Grantham. “Billionaire” is in quotes because we are using the Giving Pledge’s definition, which includes those who would be billionaires if they had not given away substantial sums of money.",

          "**[The Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/about) is “envisioned as a multi-generational effort, aiming over time to help shift the social norms of philanthropy among the world’s wealthiest and inspire people to give more, establish their giving plans sooner, and give in smarter ways.”**\n\nNow is a wonderful time to lead a life with a purpose, according to 85-year-old “billionaire” Jeremy Grantham. “Billionaire” is in quotes because we are using the Giving Pledge’s definition, which includes those who would be billionaires if they had not given away substantial sums of money. Although he has effectively given away 90% of his net worth, Grantham doesn’t consider himself a true philanthropist because his Foundation and Trust are working to make life better for his family and grandchildren through environmental protection and green energy investments. Recently, Grantham was interviewed on [Nate Hagens’ Great Simplification podcast](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/). They covered many topics critical to humanity’s survival that are receiving far too little attention, including endocrine-disrupting toxic chemical pollution, which is lowering sperm counts and fertility at alarming rates, insect extinction, and the need for a carbon tax. The questions most of us should be asking ourselves are the ones for which Grantham did not have an answer. Namely, why aren’t more academics, businesspeople, fathers, financial experts, millionaires, mothers, politicians, and retirees—who we know care about their families—focusing more of their time, money, and other resources on solving the issues critical to human survival?\n\n**There is hope, as Grantham is just one of a growing list of 240 Giving Pledge signatories. Created by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffet in 2010 with 40 signers, the Giving Pledge “is inspired by the example set by millions of people at all income levels who give generously—and often at great personal sacrifice—to make the world better.”**\n\n![nikilkamath](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1701764303/Group_5635_lel6tt.png)\n\nGrantham would concur, as wealth inequality is not only bad for the poor, but it can also lead to social unrest, a shrinking customer base for businesses, and many other societal problems. There is also the issue of environmental resource use inequality. According to [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/richest-1-bag-nearly-twice-much-wealth-rest-world-put-together-over-past-two-years), the top 1%, which includes people making over $140,000/year, are responsible for more environmental damage than the lowest 5 billion people. While many Giving Pledge signatories are waiting until they die to put their considerable resources to use and continue to live high-impact lifestyles inconsistent with human survival.\n\n Giving Pledge signatory [Chuck Feeney](https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/chuck-feeneys-story) set the standard more should aspire to. After making modest provisions for his five adult children, Feeney, who passed away on October 9, 2023, at 92, chose to live a more modest lifestyle and gave away all but $2 million of his $8 billion fortune. This included the final distribution in 2016 from his Atlantic Philanthropic Group. Because of the the urgency of our environmental problems, giving today and living a more modest lifestyle is much more impactful than giving 20 years from now.\n\n**While some think that it is too late to avoid societal collapse, Grantham feels that we still have a small window to recover from our self-inflicted destruction. For those blessed to be alive today, it’s not too late to choose to have a life with purpose.**\n\nIn these challenging times, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the problems facing our world. But the message from Jeremy Grantham and the Giving Pledge signatories is one of hope and inspiration. They remind us that now is the time to lead a life with purpose by giving back to our communities and the world around us. Giving is not just a moral obligation, it is also a powerful force for change. The Giving Pledge signatories have shown that by giving generously, we can make a positive impact on critical issues such as environmental protection, wealth inequality, and access to education and healthcare.\n\n Through their example, they have inspired a new wave of philanthropy that aims to shift the social norms of giving among the world’s wealthiest. By establishing giving plans, contributing in smarter ways and inspiring others to give, we can collectively work towards a better, more equitable world. \n\nSo let us be inspired by the Giving Pledge and embrace the power of giving. Regardless of our financial means, we can all find ways to give back and make a positive impact. Together, we can help address the urgent issues facing our world and create a brighter, more hopeful future for all.",

          "Temporary access to financial resources, as seen in Harmonyville, can significantly boost local economies. It empowers individuals to make immediate purchases, invest in their homes, and support local businesses, creating a positive ripple effect that stimulates demand and job opportunities.",
        blogContent:
          "In today’s economic landscape, access to financial resources plays a pivotal role in stimulating local economies. Even temporary access to money can foster economic growth in a community by increasing utilization of available resources.\n\nHarmonyville is an example that showcases the impact that even temporary injections of capital can have on the vitality of our neighborhoods.\n\nAccess to currency empowers individuals and families to make local purchases they might have deferred otherwise. Whether it’s covering immediate bills, investing in home improvements, or supporting local businesses, these funds create a ripple effect that benefits everyone. When people have the means to spend, local enterprises thrive, increasing demand for goods and services, and, in turn, creating job opportunities.\n\n\n![motel-number.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1698758219/Motel_dfn5xg.png)\n\n\nFurthermore, local spending can strengthen community bonds. As businesses flourish, they often give back to the communities that support them through sponsorships, donations, and job creation. Stronger local economies can lead to enhanced infrastructure, improved educational opportunities, shorter supply chains, increased resiliency and a higher quality of life for all residents. By nurturing purchasing power, we empower individuals and strengthen the very foundations of the places we call home.\n\n These are just some of the reasons local community currencies have increased in popularity. We will explore their benefits and best practices more deeply in future pieces.\n\n\n## References:\n[https://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/06/15/an-amusing-brainteaser](https://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/06/15/an-amusing-brainteaser)\n[https://mises.org/wire/misleading-brainteaser](https://mises.org/wire/misleading-brainteaser)\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobmcteer/2011/11/29/the-tale-of-the-100-bill/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobmcteer/2011/11/29/the-tale-of-the-100-bill/)\n\n\n## Discussion:\n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthew-elston-602a6424_the-ripple-effect-bolstering-local-economies-activity-7108089766960668673-YEcY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthew-elston-602a6424_the-ripple-effect-bolstering-local-economies-activity-7108089766960668673-YEcY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)",

        blogContent:
          "**In a world dominated by traditional national currencies issued by central banks, alternative forms of value exchange have a rich history that often goes unnoticed. From gift cards and loyalty programs to local currencies, these alternative currencies play a significant role in influencing behavior, fostering social connections, and supporting local economies. This blog delves into the history of non-government currencies and explores the concept of community currencies – local forms of money that coexist with mainstream currencies. These community currencies serve unique purposes and offer a multitude of benefits, from strengthening local economies and promoting sustainability to enhancing social connections and fostering civic engagement. Through a journey across various examples from different parts of the world, this piece sheds light on the potential of community currencies to reshape economic and social landscapes.**\n\n![ggln-chart.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1692264087/ggln_chart_fc2010f384.png)\n\n**The term “community currency” has gained significant traction recently, reflecting a movement towards localized economies and sustainable financial practices. As awareness of environmental, social, and economic issues spreads, communities seek alternatives to traditional currency. The concept resonates with a desire for autonomy and resilience, prioritizing local businesses, fostering community collaboration, and emphasizing values beyond monetary transactions. Recognizing potential to address economic inequalities and strengthen bonds, the popularity of “community currency” is poised to continue its upward trajectory, ushering in a new era of economic empowerment at the local level.**\n\n\nStepping beyond traditional national currencies, alternative forms of value exchange reveal a world of possibilities. Beyond major currencies like the US Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen, various currencies – old and new – shape economies and societies. Gift cards, loyalty programs, and local currencies exemplify value exchange beyond government-issued money. \n\nYet, the concept of alternative currencies reaches far back in history and runs deeper than we might realize. Many institutions, including banks, corporations, merchants, and local communities, have issued their own currencies for centuries.\n\nWhy? \n\nThese alternative currencies wield the power to influence behavior, provide credit and liquidity at low costs, bolster communities against crises, strengthen social connections, and enhance loyalty. They come into play when government-issued currency is scarce or restricted, making them an essential facet of diverse economies.\n\n\n![ngo-currency.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1692264347/ngo_currency_6784392fcc.png)\n\n\nIn the realm of community currencies, there exists a diverse landscape where some initiatives involve local government participation while others operate independently. In certain cases, community currencies establish collaborations with local government entities to amplify their impact and ensure regulatory compliance. This partnership can lead to increased recognition, resources, and support for the community currency, strengthening its ability to drive economic resilience and local development.\n\n\n![govt.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1692264449/govt_081d24d83c.png)\n\n\nOn the other hand, there are instances where community currencies function autonomously, relying on the active participation and support of community members, local businesses, and grassroots organizations. These currencies, while free from bureaucratic constraints, might face challenges in terms of visibility and scalability. The decision to involve local government or operate independently hinges on various factors, including the specific goals of the community currency, the level of community engagement, and the regulatory environment in which it operates.\n\n## **Is it time for your community to have a local currency?**\n\n\nAlternative currencies have historical significance across institutions, from banks to local communities, issued for centuries. Why? These currencies influence behavior, offer credit and liquidity, strengthen communities against crises, enhance loyalty, and operate when government currency is scarce, essential in diverse economies. \n\nWhile Bitcoin is often considered the first non-government currency, these currencies date back centuries. Before fiat currency dominated, instruments like Bills of Exchange facilitated trade, Promissory Notes ensured debt repayment, Commodity Money Certificates represented commodities, Clearinghouse Certificates aided settlements, Private Tokens acted as currency substitutes, and Merchant Guild Notes facilitated medieval trade networks.\n\nCommunity currencies are a compelling form of alternative currency, operating in specific geographic areas alongside national currencies. They serve distinct purposes, boosting local economies, supporting small businesses, fostering bonds, diversifying economies, promoting sustainability, and encouraging engagement. Tailored to local challenges, community currencies empower communities.\n\nExploring various community currencies worldwide, from Bristol Pound in the UK to Chiemgauer in Germany, Sardex in Italy, and Bangla-Pesa in Kenya, showcases their transformative potential. These currencies drive local development, bolster economies, and strengthen social fabric. \n\nIn upcoming sections, we delve into community currencies’ specifics, uncovering insights into how they can best serve local communities. Understanding their characteristics and contexts reveals how community currencies align with local needs.",

          "Regenerative practices go beyond sustainability by actively working to restore and regenerate ecosystems, fostering resilience and long-term health. These practices aim to reverse environmental degradation and promote the regeneration of natural resources, biodiversity, and soil health. From agriculture to textiles, regenerative practices can be applied across various industries, offering a holistic approach to sustainable development.",

          "**An infographic showing how the regenerative economy is significantly different from the circular or blue economy, in that these concepts stop at adapting our current economy’s means of production, whereas the regenerative economy acknowledges that our entire economic system needs to be reimagined. Where other visions on future economies strive to do no harm to our environment, the regenerative economy includes an element of healing and restoring our ecosystem, leaving it in a better state than we found it.**\n\nRegenerative practices go beyond sustainability by actively working to restore and regenerate ecosystems, fostering resilience and long-term health. These practices aim to reverse environmental degradation and promote the regeneration of natural resources, biodiversity, and soil health. From agriculture to textiles, regenerative practices can be applied across various industries, offering a holistic approach to sustainable development.\n\n_According to Daniel Christian Wahl, the author of Designing Regenerative Cultures, observes a need to rethink our definition of wealth and the role of transactions in the economy. By just defining wealth in monetary terms, he states, we miss out on the fact that by restoring the health of our ecosystems and communities we are creating wealth for all._\n\nAt Impact Ecosystem, we believe that the future lies in regenerative practices, where businesses thrive while nourishing the planet. We bring companies and NGO’s to join us on this transformative journey as we explore the regenerative economy and its potential to create a lasting positive impact by following these. \n\n**Redefining Sustainability**: Sustainability alone is no longer enough. The regenerative economy goes beyond mere preservation; it aims to restore and rejuvenate ecosystems while fostering social and economic growth. At Impact Ecosystem, we redefine sustainability by investing in businesses committed to nurturing the environment, communities, and profitability. \n\n**Embracing Circular Principles**: In the regenerative economy, waste becomes a valuable resource. We actively support businesses that adopt circular principles, promoting waste reduction, recycling, and upcycling. Together, we create a closed-loop system that minimizes environmental impact and maximizes resource efficiency.\n\n\n![Image 43.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1690874794/Image_43_862bde83a5.png)\n\n\n**Cultivating Resilient Agriculture**: Agriculture is at the core of regenerative practices. We invest in innovative farming methods that prioritize soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Our mission is to transform traditional agricultural practices into regenerative models that promote sustainable food systems.\n\n![Image 43.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1690875034/Image_43_808f1cf9a5.png)\n\n\n**Harnessing Clean Energy Solutions**: In our pursuit of a regenerative economy, renewable energy takes center stage. We support businesses that develop clean energy solutions, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. Together, we power a greener and more sustainable future. \n\n**Investing in Community Well-Being**: The regenerative economy emphasizes the well-being of local communities. Impact Ecosystem is committed to empowering marginalized communities and promoting social equity. We invest in businesses that prioritize fair labor practices, access to education, and community development.\n\n**Collaboration for Impact**: At Impact Ecosystem, we believe in the power of collaboration. We partner with like-minded organizations, NGOs, and policymakers to amplify our impact. Together, we strive to shape policies and drive systemic change that supports the transition to a regenerative economy. \n\n**Transparency and Accountability**: Trust is paramount in our journey towards the regenerative economy. We uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency. Our investors and partners receive regular updates and are actively involved in the development process, making well-informed decisions together. \n\nThe time for a regenerative economy is now, and Impact Ecosystem is at the forefront of this transformative movement. Join us as we invest in the future, where businesses thrive, ecosystems flourish, and communities prosper. Together, let’s build a world that balances progress and preservation, leaving a positive legacy for generations to come.\n\n",

          "**Vision**: Impact Ecosystem envisions a fair and regenerative world economy where human, social, and natural capital are properly valued to maximize collective happiness, health, and prosperity. \n\n**Mission**: Facilitate the widespread adoption of ie.Money, an alternative currency like gift cards, loyalty points and community inclusion currency vouchers, that incentivizes and funds Impact Ecosystem’s vision via nonprofit support, community involvement, education, impact investment, economic justice, human friendly manufacturing & purchasing decisions, biodiversity preservation, climate smart action, open-mindedness, and ecosystem service payments.\n\n\n![Image 13.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1688749453/Image_13_8482de9753.png)\n\n\n**Core Beliefs & Values**: Everyone, including individuals, corporations, governments, and NGOs should follow the Golden Rule of treating others as they would like to be treated. This includes Honesty, Fairness, Respect, Empathy, Impact Awareness, and Cooperation. While we agree with the libertarian concept of people being free to do what they want as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else, we are mindful that the economic and natural worlds are interconnected more than most realize or acknowledge. Examples include the greenhouse gas emissions from Qatar affecting the weather in Pakistan and hazardous chemicals invented in the United States finding their way into fish eaten by Norwegians.\n\nHumans have shown a tremendous capacity to adapt, cooperate and innovate in times of crisis. The current mass extinction event caused by rising CO2 levels, ignoring Planetary Boundaries and undervaluing Natural Capital provides us with the opportunity to overcome the biggest crisis we have ever faced.\n\n**Goals**: By 2025, Impact Ecosystem would like to facilitate $100 million in:\n• Grants to Non-Profits\n• Rewards for Ecosystem Services & Impact Investment \n• Discounts on Human Friendly Products & Services \n• Financing for the Transition to a Regenerative Economy \n\nWe kindly request that individuals and organizations show your support by joining Impact Ecosystem today. There is no cost or financial obligation, and all members will receive an Impact Ecosystem Governance Token to have a vote in how we operate, make grants, rewards, discounts, and funding decisions.\n\n\n![IE-poor.webp](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1686910575/IE_poor_8638ab601e.webp)\n\n\nImpact Ecosystem envisions an alternative currency, like gift cards, loyalty points and community inclusion currency vouchers, that incentivizes and funds the transition to a regenerative economy where human, social and natural capital are properly valued. \n\nPromote a fair & regenerative economy designed to maximize human health and happiness via nonprofit support, community involvement, education, impact investment, economic justice, human friendly manufacturing & purchasing decisions, biodiversity preservation, climate smart action, open-mindedness, and ecosystem service payments that properly value natural capital.",

          "The evolution of thermal energy has witnessed remarkable advancements over time. From early civilizations harnessing fire for warmth and cooking, to the invention of steam engines during the Industrial Revolution, and the modern utilization of renewable energy sources, the journey of thermal energy has been transformative.\n\nThe development of more efficient combustion processes and the discovery of new fuels have greatly improved the generation of heat. Furthermore, the rise of renewable energy technologies like geothermal, solar thermal, and biomass has paved the way for cleaner and sustainable thermal energy solutions. Today, we continue to explore innovative methods to maximize the potential of thermal energy while minimizing its environmental impact, contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.\n\nDavid Firshein, CFO of Brillouin Energy Corp, discusses the company’s solution to pollution emissions in the production of energy. The company has developed a hydrogen hot tube that generates thermal energy with zero hazardous waste byproducts.\n\n\n![Image 19.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpj1qyso/image/upload/v1688750381/Image_19_6a4dc9cdbd.png)\n\n\n\nThe technology utilizes a Q pulse generator, which blasts electricity into a catalyst rod, generating heat without hazardous waste, carbon emissions, or hazardous radiation emissions. The process has been tested and proven to work, generating commercial revenue and receiving commitments from investors to fund further development. The company aims to scale the technology from small to larger levels and reduce hot water heating bills, with potential for various commercial applications.\n\nImpact Ecosystem envisions a fair and regenerative world economy where human, social, and natural capital are properly valued to maximize collective happiness, health, and prosperity. \n\nWe Facilitate the widespread adoption of ie.money through gift cards, loyalty points and community inclusion vouchers, that incentivizes and funds Impact Ecosystem’s vision via nonprofit support, community involvement, education, impact investment, economic justice, human friendly manufacturing & purchasing decisions, biodiversity preservation, climate smart action, open-mindedness, and ecosystem service payments.\n\n",
